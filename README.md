# SpecJams
Made for Snap Spectacles '24 during AR Day London 2024

## Inspiration
We were inspired by the universal appeal of music as a way to connect people. While VR allows digital collaboration, we wanted to bring that experience into the real world, leveraging the lightweight form factor of Spectacles to create spontaneous, social interactions. The idea of combining real-world presence with creative digital tools felt like a perfect blend of AR’s potential.

## What it does
SpecJams allows users to create music collaboratively in real-world settings using AR glasses. By interacting with simple 3D objects like cubes, spheres, and cylinders, users can generate beats, melodies, and rhythms. Tapping objects triggers musical elements, and together, users can build unique soundscapes, all while staying connected in a shared physical space.

## How we built it
We built SpecJams using the Spectacles Lens Studio platform for AR development. The 3D objects were modeled and programmed to respond to user taps, with audio integration synced to interactions. Our team collaborated on the design, coding, and user interface within a tight timeline, optimizing for Spectacles’ lightweight hardware and limited battery life.

## Challenges we ran into
We faced challenges optimizing the app for Spectacles’ 30-minute battery life while ensuring smooth performance. Designing intuitive interactions with simple 3D objects and synchronizing audio in real-time across multiple devices was also tricky. Additionally, balancing creativity with simplicity to maintain user engagement required careful planning.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud of creating a seamless, real-time collaborative music experience in AR, something that’s never been done before. The integration of sound and 3D interactions within a lightweight platform like Spectacles feels like a big win. Seeing our idea come to life and watching people jam together was incredibly rewarding.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about designing this AR experience to leverage digital interactions in the real-world. Developing for Spectacles highlighted the importance of a intuitive user experiences and optimizing for a short experience regarding the battery life of about 30mins. We also gained insights into synchronizing audio and visuals on the Spectacles.

## What's next for SpecJams
Next, we want to add more instruments and sound effects, allowing users to do different jam sessions. We envision SpecJams becoming a memorable experience that you enjoy playing again and again, sparking musical creativity and social connection.
